# node-finite-state-machine
A Node project to handle Finite State Machines in a Node/TypeScript environment.

## Why node-finite-state-machine in an event-driven framework?
This package was created by a Firmware Developer as a test, to try and implement microcontroller programming concepts in a system born to work in a completely different manner.
The idea is to implement a loop which will execute a Finite State Machine, just like the main() function of a microcontroller does.

## How To Start
The NPM package will be deployed as a .tgz archive to be downloaded from this repository; this will need to be saved to your PC in a known folder.  
Once saved, add its path in the _dependencies_ section of your _package.json_ file.

> "dependencies": {  
    "node-finite-state-machine": "file:path-to-tgz-archive"  
  }

Once you have done this, cd to the root directory of your project and

```bash
npm install
```

That is all!
